# Idea Introduction

we try to place the information about antique
pieces in detail. Likewise Where that was introduced, what is the history of that pieces?
In recent years, museums have started exploring the use of blockchain technology to enhance the accuracy and security of their records related to antique pieces. Blockchain technology is a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger system that allows for the secure and transparent tracking of information.
By using blockchain technology, museums can create immutable and transparent records of an antique piece's provenance and physical attributes, which cannot be altered or deleted by anyone. This provides a high level of trust and security, as there is no central authority that controls or owns the data.
In addition to security, blockchain technology also allows for the easy sharing and collaboration of information across different institutions and organizations. This can help museums and other cultural institutions to work together more effectively to preserve and share their collections.



# Problem statement

Lack of digitization: Lack of digitization can limit access to museum collections and make it difficult to share information about antique pieces with a wider audience. This can limit the visibility and value of these objects, making it difficult to appreciate their significance and history.



# Why Blockchain

Google also provides the information about this                     antiques but this is not included with blockchain.

By providing blockchain this information is not deleted for ever. 

And no one can access to edit the information. It is highly secure for this.
