# Business Solutioning overview
Business Problem:

TO ensure the authenticity and integrity of the records of antique pieces to prevent fraud or counterfeit items from entering the collection.

Also, the business wants to provide transparency to their customers regarding the history and ownership of these artifacts.

Solution Approach:

The business can use blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof and transparent record of each antique piece's ownership and history.

This system can also allow customers to view the record of an antique piece's journey and authenticate its authenticity.

Business Flow:

A new antique piece arrives.

The business creates a new record for the item on the blockchain.

The record includes the piece's description, history, and ownership.

The record is added to the blockchain and becomes immutable.

User Journey:

Customers visit the business and see an antique piece they are interested in.

They scan the QR code on the display, which takes them to the blockchain record of the item.

They can view the item's description, history, and ownership.

They can also verify the authenticity of the item by checking its record on the blockchain.

Business Application Components:

Blockchain network for creating and storing records.

User interface for the business to create and update records.

User interface for customers to view records and authenticate antique pieces.

Security measures to ensure only authorized personnel can access and modify records.

Integration with existing business systems.

Interrelationships:

The blockchain network serves as the foundation for the entire system, and the user interfaces and security measures are built on top of it.

The blockchain network serves as the foundation for the entire system, and the user interfaces and security measures are built on top of it.

Users Authentication:

Users, including business staff and customers, can authenticate themselves using a secure login and password.

The blockchain network ensures the integrity and authenticity of each record, providing an additional layer of security.

# Solution Architecture

The essential components that would be included in the architecture for building the product web2 components are:

Database
Cloud Infrastructure
Security
Storage
Blockchain
User Interface
API

The Web3 application architecture needs for the project:

Wallets
Decentralized Storage
Smart Contracts
APIs

Overall product solution architecture, incorporating the components from both web2 and web3 are:

Frontend Technologies: The frontend would be built using modern web technologies such as React or Angular, which would allow for a fast, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

Backend Technologies: The backend would be built using Node.js, which provides a scalable and efficient platform for building server-side applications. Express.js would be used as a framework to build the APIs that interact with the smart contracts on the blockchain.

Database: The database would be a relational SQL database, used to store data that is not required to be stored on the blockchain. The database would be used to store user information, metadata associated with the antique pieces, and other relevant data.

Cloud: The application would be deployed on a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The cloud platform would provide scalability, reliability, and high availability for the application.

Data Security: The application would be designed with security in mind, using best practices for authentication, authorization, and encryption. The smart contracts would be audited for potential security vulnerabilities and the application would undergo regular security testing.

Storage (Centralized): The centralized storage would be used to store the data associated with the antique pieces that does not need to be stored on the blockchain. This would be stored in a centralized manner to provide faster access and easier management.

Wallets: The application would integrate with various wallet providers such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet to allow users to interact with the blockchain.

Decentralized Storage: The application would use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or similar decentralized storage solutions to store the data related to the antique pieces on the blockchain.

Smart Contracts: Smart contracts would be used to manage the records of antique pieces on the blockchain. These would be designed to be highly secure and transparent, ensuring that the data is accurate and immutable.

APIs: APIs would be created to allow the Web3 application to interact with the smart contracts on the blockchain, enabling third-party applications to access the data stored on the blockchain.

Overall, the product solution architecture would be designed to be highly scalable, secure, and reliable, with a focus on delivering a fast, responsive, and user-friendly experience for users. The architecture would leverage a combination of Web2 and Web3 technologies to provide a robust and innovative solution for managing the records of antique pieces.
