# Business Solutioning overview
Business Problem:

TO ensure the authenticity and integrity of the records of antique pieces to prevent fraud or counterfeit items from entering the collection.

Also, the business wants to provide transparency to their customers regarding the history and ownership of these artifacts.

Solution Approach:

The business can use blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof and transparent record of each antique piece's ownership and history.

This system can also allow customers to view the record of an antique piece's journey and authenticate its authenticity.

Business Flow:

A new antique piece arrives.

The business creates a new record for the item on the blockchain.

The record includes the piece's description, history, and ownership.

The record is added to the blockchain and becomes immutable.

User Journey:

Customers visit the business and see an antique piece they are interested in.

They scan the QR code on the display, which takes them to the blockchain record of the item.

They can view the item's description, history, and ownership.

They can also verify the authenticity of the item by checking its record on the blockchain.

Backend Technologies: The backend would be built using Node.js, which provides a scalable and efficient platform for building server-side applications. Express.js would be used as a framework to build the APIs that interact with the smart contracts on the blockchain.

Database: The database would be a relational SQL database, used to store data that is not required to be stored on the blockchain. The database would be used to store user information, metadata associated with the antique pieces, and other relevant data.

Cloud: The application would be deployed on a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The cloud platform would provide scalability, reliability, and high availability for the application.

Data Security: The application would be designed with security in mind, using best practices for authentication, authorization, and encryption. The smart contracts would be audited for potential security vulnerabilities and the application would undergo regular security testing.

Storage (Centralized): The centralized storage would be used to store the data associated with the antique pieces that does not need to be stored on the blockchain. This would be stored in a centralized manner to provide faster access and easier management.

Wallets: The application would integrate with various wallet providers such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet to allow users to interact with the blockchain.

Decentralized Storage: The application would use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or similar decentralized storage solutions to store the data related to the antique pieces on the blockchain.

Smart Contracts: Smart contracts would be used to manage the records of antique pieces on the blockchain. These would be designed to be highly secure and transparent, ensuring that the data is accurate and immutable.

APIs: APIs would be created to allow the Web3 application to interact with the smart contracts on the blockchain, enabling third-party applications to access the data stored on the blockchain.

Overall, the product solution architecture would be designed to be highly scalable, secure, and reliable, with a focus on delivering a fast, responsive, and user-friendly experience for users. The architecture would leverage a combination of Web2 and Web3 technologies to provide a robust and innovative solution for managing the records of antique pieces.

# Database Design and Decentralised Storage

Based on the requirements and architecture, the database design for this project could include the following tables:

Users table: This table would store the information about users who have access to the system, including their usernames, passwords, and email addresses. It could also include information about their roles and permissions within the system.

Antique Pieces table: This table would store the information about each antique piece, such as its name, description, origin, age, and historical significance.

Museum table: This table would store information about each museum that holds antique pieces. It could include information such as the museum name, address, contact details, and other relevant information.

Transactions table: This table would store information about all transactions that occur within the system, including the buying and selling of antique pieces. It could include information such as the date and time of the transaction, the parties involved, and the details of the piece(s) being exchanged.

Authentication table: This table would store information about the authentication of each antique piece. It could include details such as the date and time of authentication, the authentication method used, and the result of the authentication process.

Ownership table: This table would store information about the ownership of each antique piece. It could include details such as the current owner, the date of ownership transfer, and the previous owner.

The exact usage needs of the database would depend on the specific requirements of the system, but the above tables would provide a starting point for designing the database.

We can design the Database with the help of above tables. And relational SQL database.

The need of decentralized storage is becoming increasingly important in the context of blockchain-based applications due to its ability to provide greater security, reliability, and accessibility compared to centralized storage solutions. In a decentralized storage system, data is stored across a network of nodes instead of being stored on a central server or database. This makes it much harder for a single point of failure to cause data loss or corruption, as well as increasing the resistance to censorship and tampering.

In the context of this specific project, decentralized storage could be particularly useful for storing records of the antique pieces and their historical information. This information is valuable and needs to be protected from tampering or loss, and decentralized storage can provide an additional layer of security to ensure that the data remains accessible and protected

There are several options available for implementing decentralized storage, including IPFS, Arweave, and Filecoin. IPFS is a distributed file system that uses content-addressed storage to provide a permanent and decentralized way to store and share files. Arweave is a blockchain-based storage system that uses a novel consensus algorithm called Proof of Access to provide permanent, low-cost storage. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that uses a blockchain-based marketplace to incentivize users to store and share files.

The choice of which decentralized storage system to use would depend on a number of factors, including the specific needs of the project, the available resources, and the level of security and reliability required. Ultimately, the goal would be to choose a decentralized storage system that provides the best combination of security, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness for the specific requirements of the project.

This is the need of decentralized storage in this project we required it.
